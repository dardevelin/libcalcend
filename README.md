libcalcend
=========

A calculator backend library.

libcalcend aims to be an easy to use library to help building feature rich
calculator applications. It was initially designed as part of calcCMD,
however due to the desire of making everything as simple and minimal as
possible, the backend was decoupled from the main project.

libcalcend is free software, released under the GNU General Public License, meaning
you have the freedom to do as you wish with the software, including modifying,
distributing copies, and studying the source code. You are free to make your
own modified version and distribute/sell it as long as the freedoms you were
given are also given to your users (it must be released under the same license).

About the original calcCMD:
calcCMD was created initially by David McMackins during February of 2014 to
practice using Vim. The simplicity of the program makes it great for new and
aspiring C++ programmers to study the source code and learn how a simple
program works (with minimal understanding required). If you'd like to join the
